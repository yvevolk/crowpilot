## IMPORTANT
As of 23/4/24, I have removed the supertest dev dependency due to a vulnerability. Tests will not work without it. It will be re-implemented as soon as possible.

# Crowpilot API üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ‚úàÔ∏è

## What is this?
Crowpilot API is a simple RESTful API written for the Crowpilot app, utilising a MongoDB database. It is used to query, add, amend and delete user and photo data.

The front end of this app can be found on [my project partner's GitHub](https://github.com/jwiszowaty/crowpilot-frontend).

Created with Node.js, Express and Mongoose. Tested with Jest and Supertest.

**This API and accompanying app are under development and subject to change.**

## Live version
A live version can be found at https://crowpilot.onrender.com/api/.
This link includes a reference to all available endpoints.

## Data disclaimer
The data found in the database was created for testing and demonstration purposes. Any resemblance to individuals, living or dead, is purely coincidental.
